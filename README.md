# Advent Of Code 2021

* [Day 1](Day01.ipynb). Simple array manipulation. Using `np.convolve` to implement moving window for Part 2.

* [Day 2](Day02.ipynb). Part 1 with list comprehension. Part 2 quick and dirty with an explicit loop.

* [Day 3](Day03.ipynb). `numpy` FTW, and some poor man bit manipulation (probably useless for Part 1, but I'm happy ai took this road for part 2!)

* [Day 4](Day04.ipynb). In principle easy, if only I did not get stuck on part one becouse I initially forgot to check both rows and column!

* [Day 5](Day05.ipynb). Part 1 simple. Part 2 was obviously introducing diagonals, implementing them required a bit of care to preserve orientation.

* [Day 6](Day06.ipynb). An exponential growth, I better keep track of that population composition!

* [Day 7](Day07.ipynb)
